# üì• **Data Set Downloaders**

Robust data acquisition utilities for downloading DESI DR1 Value-Added Catalogs from official repositories. This directory contains intelligent download managers that handle large astronomical datasets with sophisticated progress tracking, error recovery, and user-friendly interfaces designed for reliable acquisition of multi-gigabyte survey catalogs.

## **Overview**

The Data Set Downloaders provide the critical first step in the project's data pipeline, transforming the challenge of acquiring large astronomical datasets into a streamlined, reliable process. These utilities recognize that modern survey catalogs can span hundreds of gigabytes across multiple files, requiring intelligent download strategies that handle network interruptions, storage constraints, and user workflow integration.

The implementation prioritizes user experience and operational robustness through pre-download validation, intelligent progress reporting, and idempotent operation that gracefully handles partial downloads and resumption scenarios. This foundation enables confident data acquisition for downstream analysis while providing transparent insight into dataset characteristics and transfer progress.
