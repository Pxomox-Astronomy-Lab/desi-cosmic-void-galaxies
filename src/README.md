# üìù **Work Logs**

Transparent development session documentation for the DESI cosmic void galaxy analysis project. This directory maintains detailed records of implementation progress, technical decisions, validation results, and development milestones, supporting the project's commitment to open science practices and reproducible research methodology.

## **Overview**

The Work Logs provide systematic documentation of development sessions, capturing both technical achievements and decision-making processes that shape the project's evolution. Each session log documents specific accomplishments, technical challenges encountered, validation results, and insights gained during implementation. This transparency enables community engagement, supports reproducibility, and provides valuable context for understanding the project's technical development trajectory.

These logs serve as both a development audit trail and a learning resource, documenting the systematic approach to astronomical data analysis pipeline construction. The detailed session records support peer review, enable reproducible research practices, and provide insight into the methodological decisions that underpin scientific conclusions.
