# üóÑÔ∏è **Database Infrastructure Overview**

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the PostgreSQL 16 database infrastructure supporting DESI cosmic void analysis. The database serves as the central data repository for 27.6GB of DESI DR1 data, enabling efficient spatial cross-matching and statistical analysis of galaxy properties in void environments.

# üéØ **1. Introduction**

This section establishes the foundational context for database infrastructure within the DESI cosmic void analysis project, defining the systematic approach to data storage and retrieval that enables efficient scientific analysis.
