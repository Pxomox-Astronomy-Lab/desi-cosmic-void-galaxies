## **3.1 Architecture & Design**

This subsection explains the DESI developer access management architecture and design decisions that enable systematic collaborative development and secure scientific computing.

DESI developer access management architecture employs Linux group-based permission framework with systematic file system access controls, collaborative directory organization, and comprehensive permission validation that supports scientific computing collaboration. The implementation utilizes Ubuntu 24.04 user management, POSIX permissions, and systematic access validation that enables secure collaborative development and effective environmental quenching research.

## **3.2 Developer Group Implementation**

This subsection describes the systematic implementation of developer groups and collaborative access management based on actual project requirements and implemented procedures.

### **Developer Group Creation and Configuration**

**Primary Developer Group Setup:**

```bash
# Create developers group for collaborative access
groupadd developers

# Add users to developers group
usermod -aG developers crainbramp

# Verify group membership
groups crainbramp
# Output: crainbramp : crainbramp developers
```

**Group Information and Verification:**

```bash
# Display group information
getent group developers
# Output: developers:x:1001:crainbramp

# List all group members
grep developers /etc/group
# Output: developers:x:1001:crainbramp
```

### **Collaborative Directory Structure**

**Project Directory Organization:**

```bash
# Primary project directory structure (implemented)
/mnt/data/desi-cosmic-void-galaxies/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ desivast/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/desivast/                    # 1.2GB void catalogs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ desivast-download-data-set.py     # Download automation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ desivast-fits-inspector.py        # Analysis utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fastspecfit-galaxy-properties/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/fastspecfit/                 # 26.4GB galaxy properties
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fastspecfit-download-data-set.py  # Download automation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fastspecfit-fits-inspector.py     # Analysis utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis-workspace/                   # Collaborative analysis area
```

## **3.3 Permission Management and Access Control**

This subsection provides systematic specifications for permission configuration and access control implementation that supports collaborative scientific computing.

### **File System Permissions Configuration**

**Collaborative Access Implementation:**

```bash
# Set group ownership for collaborative access
chown -R :developers /mnt/data/desi-cosmic-void-galaxies

# Configure collaborative permissions (read/write for group)
chmod -R 770 /mnt/data/desi-cosmic-void-galaxies

# Set group sticky bit for new file inheritance
chmod g+s /mnt/data/desi-cosmic-void-galaxies

# Verify permission configuration
ls -la /mnt/data/
# Output: drwxrws--- developers developers ... desi-cosmic-void-galaxies
```

**Permission Structure Explanation:**

- **User Permissions (7):** Read, write, execute for file owner
- **Group Permissions (7):** Read, write, execute for developers group
- **Other Permissions (0):** No access for other users
- **Sticky Bit (s):** New files inherit group ownership

### **Access Validation and Monitoring**

**Permission Verification Procedures:**

```bash
# Verify directory permissions
find /mnt/data/desi-cosmic-void-galaxies -type d -exec ls -ld {} \;

# Check file ownership and permissions
find /mnt/data/desi-cosmic-void-galaxies -type f -exec ls -l {} \; | head -10

# Validate group access capability
sudo -u crainbramp test -w /mnt/data/desi-cosmic-void-galaxies && echo "Write access confirmed"

# Monitor access patterns
# Note: Detailed access monitoring requires additional logging configuration
```

## **3.4 Collaborative Development Procedures**

This subsection outlines systematic collaborative development procedures and access management workflows that support scientific computing collaboration.

### **User Onboarding Framework**

**New Developer Access Procedure:**

```bash
# 1. Create user account (system administrator)
useradd -m -s /bin/bash new_developer

# 2. Add to developers group
usermod -aG developers new_developer

# 3. Verify access capabilities
sudo -u new_developer test -r /mnt/data/desi-cosmic-void-galaxies
sudo -u new_developer test -w /mnt/data/desi-cosmic-void-galaxies

# 4. Provide project orientation
echo "Welcome to DESI Cosmic Void Analysis Project" > /home/new_developer/welcome.txt
```

**Access Management Best Practices:**

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimum necessary access for project collaboration
- **Regular Access Review:** Periodic validation of group membership and access requirements
- **Collaborative Guidelines:** Systematic procedures for shared resource management
- **Data Protection:** Appropriate controls for scientific data and analysis results

### **Project Resource Management**

**Shared Resource Guidelines:**

```bash
# Data directory management
# - Original data: Read-only for preservation
# - Analysis workspace: Read-write for collaboration
# - Results: Organized by researcher/analysis type

# Storage allocation monitoring
du -sh /mnt/data/desi-cosmic-void-galaxies/*
# desivast/: 1.2GB
# fastspecfit-galaxy-properties/: 26.4GB
# analysis-workspace/: [varies by usage]

# Disk usage alerts (monitoring integration)
if [ $(df /mnt/data | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//') -gt 80 ]; then
    echo "Warning: Storage utilization exceeds 80%"
fi
```
