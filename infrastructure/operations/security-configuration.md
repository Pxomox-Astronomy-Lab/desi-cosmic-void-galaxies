### **Security Hardening Procedures**

**System Hardening Configuration:**

```bash
# Disable unnecessary services
sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon
sudo systemctl disable cups
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth

# Configure kernel security parameters
cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-security.conf
# IP Spoofing protection
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

# Ignore ICMP redirects
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0

# Ignore source-routed packets
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0

# Log Martians
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
EOF

sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-security.conf
```

## **3.3 Database Security Hardening**

This subsection provides systematic specifications for PostgreSQL database security configuration and access control implementation.

### **PostgreSQL Security Configuration**

**Authentication and Access Control:**

```sql
-- Create security-focused database roles with minimal privileges
CREATE ROLE desi_readonly;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE desi_void_desivast TO desi_readonly;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE desi_void_fastspecfit TO desi_readonly;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA raw_catalogs TO desi_readonly;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA science_analysis TO desi_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA raw_catalogs TO desi_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA science_analysis TO desi_readonly;

-- Implement row-level security for sensitive data
ALTER TABLE raw_catalogs.fastspecfit_iron ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY fastspecfit_read_policy ON raw_catalogs.fastspecfit_iron
    FOR SELECT USING (true); -- Adjust based on access requirements
```

**Database Security Hardening:**

```bash
# PostgreSQL configuration security settings
cat << EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/postgresql/16/main/postgresql.conf

# Security Configuration
ssl = off  # Enable in production with certificates
log_connections = on
log_disconnections = on
log_statement = 'mod'  # Log data modification statements
log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h '

# Connection security
password_encryption = scram-sha-256
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
EOF

sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

### **Access Control Implementation**

**Database User Management:**

```sql
-- Audit existing users and remove unnecessary privileges
SELECT rolname, rolsuper, rolcreaterole, rolcreatedb, rolcanlogin
FROM pg_roles WHERE rolcanlogin = true;

-- Implement principle of least privilege
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO desi_readonly;

-- Monitor database access and suspicious activity
SELECT datname, usename, client_addr, state, query_start, query
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'active' AND usename != 'postgres';
```

## **3.4 Network Security Configuration**

This subsection outlines systematic network security implementation including firewall configuration, network segmentation, and traffic monitoring for DESI infrastructure protection.

### **Firewall and Network Controls**

**UFW Firewall Configuration:**

```bash
# Reset firewall to default deny
sudo ufw --force reset
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow SSH access (restrict by IP in production)
sudo ufw allow ssh

# Allow PostgreSQL access only from analysis VM
sudo ufw allow from 10.25.20.3 to any port 5432

# Allow monitoring traffic
sudo ufw allow from 10.25.20.0/24 to any port 9187  # postgres_exporter
sudo ufw allow from 10.25.20.0/24 to any port 9100  # node_exporter

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw --force enable
sudo ufw status verbose
```

**Network Segmentation Strategy:**

- **Management Network (VLAN 20):** 10.25.20.0/24 - VM management and database access
- **Monitoring Network:** Limited access for Prometheus and Grafana components
- **Backup Network:** Isolated access for Proxmox Backup Server communication
- **Research Network:** Controlled access for scientific analysis and data processing

### **Intrusion Detection Configuration**

**Fail2ban Security Configuration:**

```bash
# Configure fail2ban for SSH and database protection
cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
[DEFAULT]
bantime = 3600
findtime = 600
maxretry = 3

[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
logpath = /var/log/auth.log

[postgresql]
enabled = true
port = 5432
logpath = /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-16-main.log
filter = postgresql
maxretry = 2
EOF

sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
sudo fail2ban-client status
```
