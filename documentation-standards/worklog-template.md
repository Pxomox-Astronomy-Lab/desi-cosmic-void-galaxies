## Technical Approach

### Architecture Decisions

**[Decision Name]:** [Why this approach was chosen, what alternatives were considered, what trade-offs were made]

**Example:**
**COPY vs INSERT for PostgreSQL Ingestion:** Chose PostgreSQL COPY command over individual INSERTs for 6.4M galaxy catalog. COPY achieves 150k rows/sec vs 5k rows/sec for INSERT on proj-pg01. Trade-off: Less granular error handling, but 30x throughput gain justified for bulk loads. Used chunked transactions (100k rows) to maintain crash recovery.

### Key Implementation Patterns

1. **[Pattern Name]:** [How it was implemented and what value it provides]
2. **[Pattern Name]:** [How it was implemented and what value it provides]
3. **[Pattern Name]:** [How it was implemented and what value it provides]

**Example:**

1. **Chunked FITS Processing:** Read FITS files in HDU-level chunks to avoid loading 26GB FastSpecFit catalog into memory. Used Astropy Table slicing with 100k row batches. Enabled processing on 16GB RAM proj-dp01 node.
2. **Dask Lazy Evaluation:** Leveraged Dask DataFrame for parallel feature engineering across 6.4M galaxies. Graph optimized before execution, utilizing all 4 cores on proj-dp01. Reduced 3-hour sequential processing to 45 minutes.

### Technical Innovations

- [Novel approach or solution developed during this session]
- [Clever workaround or optimization discovered]
- [Reusable component or pattern created]

**Example:**

- **Spatial Index Strategy:** Implemented dual-index approach with GIST(ra, dec) for angular searches and B-tree(redshift) for radial cuts. Enables <1s void proximity queries on 6.4M rows by pre-filtering redshift slice before 2D spatial search.

### Performance Benchmarks

| Metric   | Target | Achieved | Notes     |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | --------- |
| [Metric] | [Goal] | [Result] | [Context] |

**Example:**

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| FITS Load Speed | >50MB/s | 180MB/s | Samsung PM983 NVMe on proj-pg01, sequential read |
| PostgreSQL Ingestion | >100k rows/sec | 150k rows/sec | COPY command, 100k row chunks, proj-pg01 |

| Embedding Training | <8 hours | 4.2 hours | PyTorch on gpu01, 16-dim autoencoder |

### Data Quality Checks

[If applicable - validation queries run, integrity checks performed, scientific plausibility confirmed]

**Example:**

```sql
-- Row count validation
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM raw_catalogs.fastspecfit_galaxies;
-- Result: 6,445,927 ✓

-- Redshift range sanity check
SELECT MIN(z), MAX(z), AVG(z) FROM raw_catalogs.fastspecfit_galaxies;
-- Result: z_min=0.001, z_max=1.02, z_avg=0.31 ✓ (expected for DESI BGS)

-- Null rate check on critical columns
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE logmstar IS NULL) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS null_pct_mass,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE sfr IS NULL) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS null_pct_sfr
FROM raw_catalogs.fastspecfit_galaxies;
-- Result: 0.02% null rate ✓ (acceptable)
```

## Integration Points

**Database:** [Connection requirements, credentials handling, which database/schema]

**Example:**

- **proj-pg01 (10.25.20.8:5432)** - Primary PostgreSQL 16 instance
- **Databases:** `desi_void_desivast`, `desi_void_fastspecfit`
- **Credentials:** Loaded from `/opt/global-env/research.env` (PGSQL01_* variables)
- **Schema:** `raw_catalogs` for ingested FITS data, `derived` for feature engineering outputs

**File System:** [Data locations, input/output paths, file operations performed]

**Example:**

- **Input:** `/mnt/data/desi-dr1/fastspecfit/healpix_*.fits` (26.4GB total)
- **Output:** PostgreSQL database `desi_void_fastspecfit` + `/mnt/data/metadata/fastspecfit_schema.json`
- **Temp:** `/tmp/fits_chunks/` for intermediate processing (auto-cleanup)

**External APIs:** [Any API integrations and their configuration]

**Example:**

- **NERSC DESI Archive:** Public S3-compatible API for FITS downloads
- **Endpoint:** `https://data.desi.lbl.gov/public/` (anonymous access for DR1)
- **Rate Limiting:** 10 concurrent connections, resume-on-failure via `edge01` download node

**Other Scripts:** [Dependencies on other project scripts or components]

**Example:**

- **Upstream:** `desivast-download-data-set.py` (provides void FITS files)
- **Downstream:** `validate_stage1_integrity.py` (consumes PostgreSQL tables for QA)
- **Shared:** `config.ini` for database credentials (to be migrated to `.env`)

## Lessons Learned

### Challenges Overcome

| Challenge | Root Cause | Solution | Technical Approach |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| [Problem encountered] | [Why it happened] | [How it was solved] | [Method/tool used] |

**Example:**

| Challenge | Root Cause | Solution | Technical Approach |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| PostgreSQL `isfinite()` cast error on `logmstar` column | DOUBLE PRECISION type incompatible with `isfinite()` function expecting numeric | Explicit cast to numeric type | Changed query to `WHERE isfinite(logmstar::numeric)` |
| Memory overflow processing 26GB FastSpecFit FITS | Attempted to load entire catalog into pandas DataFrame | Chunked processing with Dask | Switched to `dask.dataframe.read_table()` with 100k row partitions |
| Spatial queries timing out (>60s) on 6.4M rows | Missing spatial index on (ra, dec) | Created GIST index | `CREATE INDEX USING GIST(ra, dec)` reduced query to 0.85s |

### Technical Insights

- [Key technical learning or discovery from this session]
- [Important insight about tools, libraries, or approaches]
- [Performance characteristic or limitation discovered]

**Example:**

- **COPY Performance Scaling:** PostgreSQL COPY throughput on proj-pg01 saturates around 150k rows/sec regardless of chunk size beyond 100k rows. Larger chunks (500k+) didn't improve throughput but increased memory pressure and crash recovery time. Sweet spot: 100k rows per transaction.
- **Dask Overhead:** For datasets <1M rows, Dask overhead (graph building, task scheduling) exceeds benefits. pandas outperforms Dask below this threshold. Crossover point on proj-dp01: ~1.2M rows.
- **FITS HDU Confusion:** DESIVAST uses HDU[1] for data (HDU[0] is empty primary), but FastSpecFit healpix files vary by release. Always call `hdul.info()` before assuming structure.

### Process Insights

- [What worked well in the development approach]
- [Collaboration pattern that proved efficient]
- [Time-saving technique or workflow improvement]

**Example:**

- **Config File Strategy:** Centralizing database credentials in `config.ini` enabled rapid iteration across scripts without hardcoding. Downside: plaintext credentials. Next step: migrate to `.env` with `python-dotenv` for production.
- **Validation-First Approach:** Running integrity checks (Stage 1) immediately after ETL caught schema mismatches early. Saved ~4 hours by avoiding downstream feature engineering on corrupt data.

### Reusable Components

- **[Component Name]:** [What it does and where it can be reused]
- **[Component Name]:** [What it does and where it can be reused]

**Example:**

- **`fits_inspector.py` module:** Generic FITS metadata extractor, reusable for any DESI VAC (FastSpecFit, EMLines, etc.). Handles HDU detection, column type inference, and range sampling.
- **`chunked_copy_ingestion()` function:** PostgreSQL bulk loader with transaction batching. Abstracted for reuse with any tabular FITS → PostgreSQL pipeline. Parameters: chunk_size, table_name, column_mapping.

2. **Run Stage 2 validation:** Execute `validate_stage2_physical_plausibility.py` to confirm redshift distributions, mass-z correlations match expectations (target: <2 hours)
3. **Begin feature engineering:** Compute local density (k-NN), void-centric radii, quenching state flags for 6.4M galaxies using Dask on proj-dp01 (target: <4 hours)

### Enhancement Opportunities
